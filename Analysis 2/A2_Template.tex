\textbf{Analysis 1}\bigskip

\textbf{1a}: My ID number is [12345678]. I will be analyzing [@username]'s tweets.\bigskip

\textbf{1b}: I [do/do not] have concerns about sample error in this study. This is because [brief justification].\bigskip

\textbf{1c}: Q-Q plot of \texttt{length}:

\textbf{1f}: One way in which a scatterplot is an appropriate summary for these data is [description of reason]. One way in which a scatterplot is not an appropriate summary for these data is [description of reasons].\bigskip

\textbf{1g}: The sample correlation is [number]. This suggests that [description of what the sample correlation tells us for this sample].\bigskip

\newpage

\textbf{1h}: The assumptions of a Binomial model are [describe assumptions]. For this variate, [discussion of whether these assumptions seem reasonable].\bigskip

\textbf{1i}: In the context of this study, $\theta$ represents [answer continues].\bigskip

\textbf{1j}: The maximum likelihood estimate is [number]. This was calculated by [brief explanation].\bigskip

\textbf{1k}: Side-by-side boxplot of \texttt{length.long} and \texttt{likes.log}:

\textbf{Analysis 2}\bigskip

\textbf{2a}: My ID number is [12345678]. I will be analyzing [@username]'s tweets.\bigskip

\textbf{2b}: I [do/do not] have concerns about measurement error in the \texttt{media} variate. This is because [brief justification].\bigskip

\textbf{2c}: Summary statistics:

\end{itemize}

\textbf{2d}: In the context of this study, $\lambda$ represents [answer continues].\bigskip

\textbf{2e}: The maximum likelihood estimate is [number]. This was calculated by [brief explanation].\bigskip

\textbf{2f}: The maximum likelihood estimate is [number]. This was calculated by [brief explanation].\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{| r | r | r |}\hline
\texttt{media} & Observed & Expected \\\hline
0 &  & \\
1 &  & \\
2 &  & \\
3 &  & \\
4 &   &  \\\hline
\end{tabular}

\textbf{2k}: Based on the results of Analyses 2i and 2j, the Poisson model appears to [description of how well the model fits the data]. In addition, [discussion of other considerations that impact the suitability of the Poisson model, and whether they are satisfied].\bigskip




\textbf{2l}: Summary statistics for \texttt{likes.log} and use of media:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| r | r | r |}\hline
Sample & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Media use}\\
